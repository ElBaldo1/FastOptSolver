# FastOptSolver
"Implementation and benchmarking of optimization algorithms such as ISTA, FISTA, L-BFGS, and Dual-FISTA for convex optimization problems. The project focuses on efficient solvers for L1 and L1-L2 regularized models, with an emphasis on computational performance and real-world applications in regression and embedded systems."
